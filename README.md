========

My personal site build. This is a work in progress and is not live yet.

Installation

If you'd like to run this application, clone the repo and `cd/to/it/in/terminal`

(You'll need to have npm installed)

run `npm install && bower install`

run `grunt server`

Play around.

Clear TODOs:

- Link with Wordpress back-end (RESTfully)
- Style individual page elements

Obviously all the files/modules installed by running the above commands do not form part of the production code. They simply build a complete local development environment.
